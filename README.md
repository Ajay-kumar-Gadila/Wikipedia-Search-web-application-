# Wikipedia-Search-web-application-


Created Wikipedia search application and utilized HTML to structure the layout of the web page and create various HTML elements such as input fields, buttons, and div tags. CSS was used to style the web page and make it visually appealing to the user.

JavaScript played a crucial role in the application's functionality. I implemented the search feature using JavaScript's built-in fetch API, which allowed me to make HTTP requests to Wikipedia's API and retrieve the necessary data.
